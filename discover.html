            <h2>Cherokee County Courthouse</h2>
            <p>
              This historic courthouse was built in 1928 of grey-white stone.
              Listed on the US’ National Register of Historic Places since 1981,
              it replaced an early structure destroyed by fire. The current
              building follows the Greek Revival style of architecture, which
              was particularly popular at the time. It is significant for being
              one of the only courthouses in Georgia built of local marble,
              rather than brick. In addition to its function as a historic
              courthouse and jail, this building is also the home of a museum to
              the history of Canton and Cherokee County.

            <h2>Etowah Water Trail</h2>
            <p>
              The Etowah River cuts across northern Georgia for 262 km, and
              splits Canton into two halves. Its water trail follows it for its
              entire length, which includes the section flowing through Canton.
              A great way of getting onto the water without even having to leave
              the city’s boundaries, Etowah River Park is the location of a boat
              ramp. From here you can head either towards East Cherokee Drive
              around 20 km away, or Boiling Park, a much more achievable 3.2 km
              away. Suitable for new paddlers, the water trail shifts between
              entirely unspoilt woodland and rural landscapes that perfectly
              capture what the south is all about.

            <h2>Etowah Indian Mounds</h2>
            <p>
              Head 40 minutes southwest from Canton and you’ll reach Etowah
              Indian Mounds Historic Site, on the northern bank of the Etowah
              River. An important archaeological site, it was a major hub for
              the native American Mississippi Culture from around 1000 to 1500
              AD. One of the most intact sites of its kind in the south eastern
              United States, there are three main platform mounds and a further
              three smaller ones. The highest, entirely man-made, rises close to
              20 m over the surrounding landscape, making it as tall as a
              six-storey building. The onsite museum displays many of the
              objects discovered here during digs, including statues, pottery,
              and jewelry.

            <h2>Centennial Olympic Park</h2>
            <p>
              There are some very impressive sites and attractions in Atlanta,
              but the one that has done more to boost the city in recent years
              than any other is probably this urban park. It was constructed as
              a legacy project of the 1996 Atlanta Summer Olympic Games, and
              takes its name from the fact these games came exactly 100 years
              after their first modern version in Athens, Greece. Made up of
              nine hectares right in the downtown district, be sure not to miss
              the Fountain of Rings. This water feature consists of 251
              individually computer-controlled jets that move to music multiple
              times each day and jump up to ten metres into the air. To get
              there, head south for around 45 minutes.

            <h2>Funk Heritage Center</h2>
            <p>
              The Funk Heritage Center in Waleska, Georgia, is Georgia's
              official frontier and southeastern Indian interpretive center.
              Located on the campus of Reinhardt University, the center houses a
              gallery of Native American artifacts and artwork, as well as a
              theater, which features a short film on the history of Native
              Americans in the southeastern United States. A small souvenir shop
              is also available. A 2003 statute named the center as Georgia's
              official Frontier and Southeastern Indian Interpretive Center.
